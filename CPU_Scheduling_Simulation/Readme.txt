This program uses threads to simulate how a cpu schedules processes
It includes load balancing if a processor core (thread) has no processes to run

The "processes" are read in from a binary file 

The different scheduling algorithms implemented in this program are:
Priority Queue
Shortest Job First
Round Robin
First Come First Serve


Because of the use of pthreads this must be run in a Linux or Unix enviornment.
